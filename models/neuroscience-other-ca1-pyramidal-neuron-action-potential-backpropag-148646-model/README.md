**Authors**: modeldb

## Description

{"value": "\" ... the investigation of AP backpropagation and its functional roles has greatly benefitted from computational models that use biophysically and morphologically accurate implementations.


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the modeldb repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
